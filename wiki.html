  <h2 id="food">Food</h2>
  
  <details><summary>Clever Koi</summary>
    <p>Our favorite Ramen spot in Phoenix. Food and drink is always great.</p>
  </details>
  
  <details><summary>Blanco</summary>
    <p>Our favorite Mexican restaurant in Phoenix. Not only is the food delicious, but the drinks are some of the best around. If I ever had to take a friend to <i>one</i> Mexican restaurant in the city, knowing I'd be able to get a seat, it'd be here.</p>
  </details>
  
  <details><summary>Zipps</summary>
    <p>This is the only sports bar that matters in Phoenix. We've never been disappointed at the location in Midtown. Chicken fingers and wings are delicious, especially when ordered with one of their Desert Donkey Mules.</p>
  </details>

  <details><summary>Parlor</summary>
    <p>Our favorite pizza place in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area. Carly loves the summer corn pizza.</p>
  </details>
  
  <details><summary>Bad Jimmy's</summary>
    <p>The best burgers we've had in the city so far. It's a perfect balance of quality food and exciting atmosphere. Music is always great, they've got a fun bar and they stay open relatively late. Only drawback is that it's pretty pricey for a burger joint.</p>
  </details>
  
  <details><summary>Glai Baan</summary>
    <p>Best Thai food in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area.</p>
  </details>
  
  <details><summary>Culinary Dropout</summary>
    <p>Fun environment. Great outdoor seating when the weather is nice. Can be loud when it gets busy, but otherwise the food and drinks are great.</p>
  </details>
  
  <details><summary>Welcome Diner</summary>
    <p>Very much a diner atmosphere. The only thing better than the food are the people who work here. The chicken biscuits are the best items on the menu without a doubt. Just make sure that you're prepared to either take some home with you or spend some time near the bathroom later.</p>
  </details>

  <details><summary>Federal Pizza</summary>
    <p>Good pizza in the Uptown area. Cheesey garlic bread is ðŸ”¥</p>
  </details>
  
  <details><summary>Oregano's</summary>
    <p>If you want tasty Italian food with large serving sizes, and don't want to have to spend a lot of money, this is the place. You can never go wrong with the chicken parm and some of the garlic cheese bread.</p>
  </details>

  <h2 id="drink">Drinks</h2>
  
<details><summary>Central Records</summary>
    <p>If you get here around 5-6 pm it's usually pretty quiet, aside from the great music they've always got playing. Drinks are good, and they have a cool collection of records and books/zines.</p>
  </details>

  <details><summary>Lola Coffee</summary>
    <p>Our go-to coffee shop in the Downtown Phoenix area. The people are friendly, the atmosphere is cozy, and the coffee (and butter croissants) are great.</p>
  </details> 

<details><summary>Gracie's Tax Bar</summary>
    <p>Cheap drinks and appetizers (mostly chicken nuggets and tater tots). Fun, dive bar atmosphere. The first time we went they had Twilight playing at the bar. That should say it all.</p>
  </details>
  
  <details><summary>Pigtails</summary>
    <p>Another place we feel obligated to take a visiting friend or family member. Cocktail bar located downtown that's tucked behind an unassuming oyster kitchen. The drinks are great, and we almost always order the cauliflower appetizer.</p>
  </details>

  <details><summary>Wilderness DTPHX</summary>
    <p>Local brewery with great outdoor seating, right on Roosevelt near Downtown. When the weather is perfect this is one of the places to have a drink.</p>
  </details>
  
  <details><summary>Eden Rooftop Bar</summary>
    <p>Easy-to-get-into rooftop bar <i>right</i> in the middle of downtown. Great view of the city, relatively affordable for drinks in that area.</p>
  </details>
  
  <details><summary>Little O's</summary>
    <p>Near the C/A office off of McDowell. Fun patio area with good cocktails. The guacamole was good the one time we tried it.</p>
  </details>
  
  <details><summary>McKenzie's Midtown Tavern</summary>
    <p>Close your eyes and try to imagine the bar that Matt Damon and Ben Affleck hang out at in Good Will Hunting. Open your eyes. You're inside Mckenzie's enjoying a drink at half the price of the next closest bar.</p>
  </details>
  
  <details><summary>Bitter & Twisted</summary>
    <p>Fun cocktail bar in the middle of Downtown. It gives speakeasy vibes in the sense that it's hardly lit. The drinks are good, but as pricey as you'd imagine them to be Downtown.</p>
  </details>

  <h2 id="shopping">Shopping</h2>
    
  <details><summary>Changing Hands Bookstore</summary>
    <p>Locally owned bookstore with a cafe & bar tucked inside. Buy your books locally <i>whenever</i> you can!</p>
  </details>

  <details><summary>Monsoon Market</summary>
    <p>Our favorite neighborhood shop in the Midtown area. They've got a great selection of beverages, from all sorts of natural wines to great tasting non-alocholic drinks.</p>
  </details>

  <details><summary>Local Nomad</summary>
    <p>Another great small business in the Uptown area. Owned by some really cool folks, the shop sells a lot of thoughtful home goods.</p>
