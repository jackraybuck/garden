<h1>Our Little Garden</h1>


<p id="dek";">This is a space to re-learn some basics of HTML and CSS. We'd also like to make it a space where we can put writings, poetry, photos, drawings, and anything else that feels like a representation of the two of us. This site reflects who we are at a fundamental level, as it will always be a work in progress.</p>
