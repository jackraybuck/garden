<h1>Poems</h1>
<p id="dek";">These are a collection of poems that get updated as they're written. Some took days to write, others were quickly composed in the Notes app of our phones while sitting at the bar. Not all of the poems are about anything in particular. Sometimes words just sound nice sitting alongside one another. Other times there's something that wants to be said.</p>

<h3 style="margin-bottom:-10px;">Tattoos</h3>
<pre>
The guy at the bar
is showing off his tattoos.
No one seems to care.

<h3 style="margin-bottom:-10px;">Closing time</h3>
<pre>
Stained linoleum,
drinks with far too much liquor.
"Can we close our tab?"
</pre>

<h3 style="margin-bottom:-10px;">Best friends</h3>
<pre>
I miss you, but do
You miss me, I wanna

Talk about nothing, and
Smoke lots of weed, have you

Heard from them, they haven't
Heard from me, I

Found a girl, and we
Packed up our things
</pre>

<h3 style="margin-bottom:-10px;">Midnight</h3>
<pre>
There goes the moon
What do you think?
It's yellow and blue
with rose-tinted cheek
Reminds me of you
the way that it blinks

Well there goes th moon.
</pre>

<h3 style="margin-bottom:-10px;">Brushed shoulders</h3>
<pre>
I left my heart at home to rest
The bird is safest in its nest
I used to float by now I fall
Not the same person, after all

I thought I saw you the other day
We made a look, you walked away
You're just someone I used to know
I'd like to get back
</pre>
