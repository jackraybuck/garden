Jack started working on our repository of favorite restaurants, bars, shops, and things to do in Phoenix. Now we'll never forget a good restaurant or yummy drink.</div>

We're looking at JL Patisserie's baking classes on their website. Looks like they have a French Croissant class. Hmm...</div>

It's Sunday morning. We just got back from getting coffee at Lola. Now we're sitting at the living room table, making a grocery list for the week. Should we try to make homemade Pad Thai?</div>

Tina brought some lemons to the office today. I'm assuming she picked these off a tree in her yard. I'm bringing them back home and turning them into a drink that will help relieve any anxieties of the day. Thanks, Tina.</div>

<div><h3>March 4, 2023</h3>Carly made some shrimp tacos with pineapple, jalape√±o, and cilantro-lime crema last night. Wow, were they delicious! Better than most of the stuff I've had at restaurants around here. We should do them again sometime soon.</div>

<div><h3>March 3, 2023</h3>This is the first sticky note that we're planting in our official garden of thoughts. This page can act as a catch-all for any of our thoughts, ideas, goals, hopes, dreams, recipes, etc. When we look back at these every once in awhile, we'll get an idea of where we were and what was going on around that time.</div>
