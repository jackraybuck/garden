<div><h3>March 5, 2023</h3>
a new chord shape that<br>
made me think of all the things<br>
you and i could do</div>

<div><h3>March 4, 2023</h3>Carly made some shrimp tacos with pineapple, jalape√±o, and cilantro-lime crema last night. Wow, were they delicious! Better than most of the stuff I've had at restaurants around here. We should do them again sometime soon.</div>

<div><h3>March 3, 2023</h3>Carly told me I always say the word butthole like <i>buttle</i>, without pronouncing the letter h. Then she said re<i>butthole</i> which we both laughed at.</div>

<div><h3>March 3, 2023</h3>This is the first sticky note that we're planting in our official garden of thoughts. This page can act as a catch-all for any of our thoughts, ideas, goals, hopes, dreams, recipes, etc. When we look back at these every once in awhile, we'll get an idea of where we were and what was going on around that time.</div>
